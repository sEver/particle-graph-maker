This is is a graph constructor originally written on codepen.
  HowTo:
  - Ctrl+drag a node to move it.
  - Shift+click to start links (you can start multiple links from different nodes and attach them to one node).
  - Click on a node after you've started some links, to attach your links to that node.
  - Meta+click to start an alternative link (different color)
  - use dat.GUI panel on the right and "addParticle" button to add new node.

 - to save the graph, use dat.GUI panel storaga->save, the map will be saved to localStorage
  Mechanics of particle and approach inspired by
